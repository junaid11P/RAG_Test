The old lighthouse stood as a silent sentinel against the crashing waves. For over a century, its beam had cut through the darkest storms, guiding sailors safely home. Elias, the keeper, climbed the spiral stairs with a weary but determined step. The wind howled outside, rattling the thick glass panes, but inside, the air was warm and smelled of oil and salt.
He reached the lantern room and checked the mechanism. It was a precise arrangement of gears and lenses, a masterpiece of engineering from a bygone era. Elias polished the brass fittings, his reflection distorted in the golden metal. He knew that tonight would be difficult; the radio had warned of a hurricane approaching from the east.
As the first heavy drops of rain struck the glass, Elias engaged the rotation gear. The massive lens began to turn, casting its rhythmic light across the turbulent ocean. Flash. Darkness. Flash. Darkness. It was a heartbeat for the coast, a promise that someone was watching. Down below, the village lights flickered and died as the power grid failed, but the lighthouse beam remained constant, powered by its trusty generator. Elias sat in his chair, watching the storm unleash its fury, knowing that as long as he was there, the light would not fail.
